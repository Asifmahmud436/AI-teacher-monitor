My dear respected brothers and sisters. Today, I'm going to talk about a topic that is literally on the mind of every one of us. If it is not daily, maybe every month, and sometimes even every hour. If you watch the news on a daily basis, every five minutes, every half an hour, every one hour, you might actually think of this all the time. And this question is, when will Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala change the circumstances of our ummah from where it is today to something better? Who doesn't think of this all the time? All of us. But subhanAllah, every time we think of this thought, we immediately and subconsciously quote the ayah in the Quran. SubhanAllah is like, we know what the problem is. We also know the solution. Where most of us are stuck and feel that they fail or they they fall short is where do I start? And who should take the initiative? And where should we begin this change? We know all we all know the issues that face our that face our families, that face our communities. SubhanAllah, some of us are away from the deed. Some of us are away from the path of Allah SubhanAllah. Our relationship with Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, many of us, this relationship is a poor relationship. Many of us deal with haram. They build many of us build haram relationship before marriage and after marriage. Many of our wives and daughters are not dressed according to the Islamic dress code. Even in Muslim countries. Right? Many of our Muslim leaders are corrupt to the point even our scholars, some of them are corrupt. And that's a fact. Our is divided. And on top of that, we fight with each other as Muslims. Right? And the list goes on. I don't want to sound too negative. It's already depressing. But that's the reality. Right? We don't dig our heads in the sand and pretend that everything is great. The prophet told us, That when people see the and they don't change it, everyone says it's not my business, that someone else start. Then the punishment of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala becomes imminent. And Allah subhanahu ta'ala can punish his in any shape and form that he chooses. It's not up to you or I to choose what kind of punishment Allah will bring to those who are sinful. So at the same time, we all know that the solution and the aza of this ummah is if we all go back to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. We know that the aza is in our deen, but yet many of us struggle to come back to this deen. So let me ask you a question and ask myself first and foremost. Name one thing about yourself that you would like to change in your life. One thing. What is that you wish if I could change this in my life? It could be, you know, I always miss Fajr at the Masjid. I pray at home. I wish I can wake up in the morning and go to the Salat and Fajr at the Masjid. Or I wish I could spend more time with my children. Or I wish I could spend less time on social media. Or I wish I could read the Quran more often. What is it that one thing that you really wish to do but you're struggling with? Now, the worst thing can be is if you tell me brother, I'm perfect. I have absolutely nothing to change. Right? I'm perfect. Of course, that's the answer I expect you to tell your wife if she comes and tell you, Habib, what do I need to change? You tell her nothing. You are perfect. Then you make her day. Okay? But for you and I, there's a lot to change. For us as a community, there's a lot to change. For us as families living in the west, there's a lot to change. For us as an ummah, there's a lot to change. So we have to be serious about it. My dear respected brothers and sisters, bad habits don't go away on their own. They are replaced by good ones. You replace them by good ones. Many of us come to salat al jumma in the last ten minutes of the khutbah. True? Look at the masjid. Almost, if I ask everyone to move forward and fill the gaps, we're half the masjid. Where is the rest? It's like we come to the masjid to check the box on Friday. Done. This is the time where you charge yourself spiritually. You bring yourself closer to Allah so you sustain and you you you you can withstand and weather the storm of life until next Friday. It's not about checking the box. Our relationship with social media, how often do we spend? How much time do we spend on social media? How much do in do we invest as parents in the future of our children? Of course, many of us invest money to send them to college and ask them to get a degree. But how many of our children know how to pray? Look at the average age in this masjid, mostly above forty. Of course, it's a school time, but even when there is no school, you don't find a lot of young people in the masjid. That should raise a red flag for us as a Muslim community living in the West. When was it the last time you prayed Jamah with your children at home? When was it the last time you called your wife and children to pray Jamah with them at home? I can tell you about myself. I honestly don't remember the last time I prayed alone at home when I have to pray at home. Even if me and only my three year old daughter at home, I'll ask you to come pray jama'ah with me. That's how we raise our children. We don't put life on cruise control and hope that our children, the future generations will fill this masjid one day. It's not going to happen if we ignore them. When was it the last time you took your children with you to the masjid to Salat al Fajr? This is the change I'm asking about. So if you say I have nothing to change, then we really have a problem. As I said, bad habits don't go away, they are replaced with good ones. Therefore, we should embrace change. It's uncomfortable, but it's the nature of life. SubhanAllah, the only constant in life is change. If you look around you, look at the seasons, they change four times during the year. Allah subhanahu ta'ala talks about the sun, the moon. Right? The night and the day. Everything in this universe is in constant change. So why you and I cannot change? Why you and I cannot change and should not embrace change. Change happens at the end of your comfort zone. Even if you change to the better, it will be associated with discomfort. But once you break that habit, trust me, you will enjoy it. If you don't wake up for fajr or tahajud, try it. It's gonna be painful the first week. Maybe maybe the first month. But once you get into it, Allah you will enjoy it. I will make dua for me. Because it makes you feel special. You build a special relationship with Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Now notice when Allah subhanahu ta'ala says, For those who know Arabic, the word qom came and the sentence is a negative. And when these two are combined in one sentence, it means collective. Allah didn't say when an individual change himself or a change will not happen until an individual changes himself. What he said, no. He said, Allah will not change the circumstances of a group of people unless they all change what's in themselves. Right? So this ayah means collective, which means, my dear respected brothers and sisters, change is collective is not individual. For a for a change to make an impact, it has to be collective. However, the individuals making this change have to adhere to the rules of the change for that change to work. I hope I'm clear. Let me repeat it. Change to have an impact, it's collective. But the individuals who are doing the change have to adhere to the rules of this change. You see it best in Ramadan. Come to the masjid for salat al isha the night before Ramadan starts. Almost five people praying Eshar or ten people. First night of Ramadan, the Masid is full. Why? You can feel the change because everyone embraced the rules of change, which is to fast during the day and come and pray taraweeh at night. Right? Let me give you a story or share with you a story that kind of confirms that. There was a village and that village was facing starvation, famine. But some of the people in that village were doing well, others were doing okay, and some families were struggling, were hungry. So the chief of that village, let's assume it's a village of a thousand people. The chief of that village told everyone, I want those who are comfortable living comfortably to come at night and contribute only one cup of milk. So I'm going to to put a big empty pot in the center of the village, and I want everyone who can to come at night without anyone seeing what you're doing and pour only one cup of milk in this pot. And in the morning, we will collect it and share it with the poor one, the needy ones in our community. So he did, and people went to that pot at night. Comes the morning, the chief walks into that pot and looked inside it, and what did he find? The pot was full of water, not milk. What happened? Did everyone pour water or did the milk change overnight became water? The fact is everyone actually poured water, not milk. Why? Because everyone said, well, everyone in the village is going to pour milk. What if I go and pour one glass of water? A thousand people put a thousand cups of milk in that pot and I put one cup of water. No one will even notice. And everyone in the village thought exactly the same thought, the same way. But if I put one cup of water in this big pot full of milk, no one will notice. Right? So none of the individuals adhered to the rules of change, so change didn't happen. So a change is collective when everyone adheres to the rules of change. That's kind of the moral of the story. And as I said, you see that clearly during the month of Ramadan which is very near to us. Now, at the end of the day, while change is important for the group, it's also important for the individuals, for you. When you change yourself, yeah, you help everybody, but you also help yourself. Allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the Quran. Whoever does good, it's for their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Your Lord is never unjust to his creation. He also said in says in the Quran, we have bound every human's destiny to their neck. And on the day of judgment, we will bring forth to each person a record which they will find laid open. And it will be said, read your record. You are sufficient this day to take account of yourself. Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And we would never punish people until we have sent a messenger to warn them. This is what Allah says. Allah says Now the word nafs was mentioned in this ayah. What is nafs? A lot of people translate it as soul. Right? Which is not. To make it simple, nafs is when you sit alone with yourself and you talk to yourself. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do planning for, you know, build a house, buy a house, buy a car, you know, marry the children, you know, send my children to college. That's your nefs. It's the nefs, it's the thing that's responsible for your thoughts, your actions, your character, your manners, whether it's good or bad, it's your nafs. It's the thing that controls your overall behavior. Right? Allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the Quran, And by the nafs and the one who fashioned it. Then with the knowledge of right and wrong inspired it. Successful indeed is the one who purifies their nafs and doomed is the one who corrupts it. Your nafs is very much influenced. It's not dictated. It's not determined, but influenced by your genetic coding. But you can bypass that. Meaning, you can find someone who was raised and born and raised in a bad family. Family that takes drugs, alcohol, you know, all the bad things, But ends up being an imam of a masjid. Right? So the genetic heritage did not really impacted where he ended in his life. And the other way around, you find people who were raising good family. Memorize the Quran, but you know, they die drunk. Right? So it's influenced by your genetic coding, but it doesn't dictate where it goes, how you end your life. Right? That's why the prophet told us The smart one is the one who always looks back at himself, questions his actions, make sure that he is on the right path, and prepares himself for life after death. And the disabled, the weak, the unintelligent is that who just follows his nafs, his desires, let it run on its own like a wild animal and hope that Allah subhanahu ta'ala will forgive. Right? What does what does this hadith and the ayah I just mentioned before? Means. It means that you have control over your nafs. Don't say I'm like this, you know, Allah made me, you know, created me to be rude to people or be angry all the time and upset and pessimistic and negative. You can't say that. Your nafs is like you're riding a horse, you can control it. You can take it to the right or simply like driving a car. When you turn it right, it goes right. Turn the steering wheel left, left, hit the brake, it stops. It's your nafs. You control it. You decide how it behaves. Right? Successful is the one who purifies his nafs. So it can be trained, it can be contained, it can be guided to the right path. Your nafs. Don't blame it on anyone else. The poet said, that the soul or the the nafs, excuse me, the the nafs is seeks desire when you expose it to desires. But you can hold it back if you teach it to accept and be satisfied with a little. Now, we know what nafs. So what is ruah? Right? Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says in the Quran, They ask you a prophet about the spirit, say, its nature is known only to my Lord, to Allah. And you all humanity have been given but little knowledge. What does that mean? Ruah, again, to make it simple, it's the energy that allows your body to function the way it does. Make it even simpler, it's like the gasoline or the gas you put in your car. Without gas, it doesn't matter what fancy car you buy, it's not gonna go anywhere. You need that energy. If you're driving a Tesla, you need a battery. Right? It's the energy that makes your body function. As soon as this roach comes out, this body collapses. Right? It's the thing, it's the energy that allows your heart to beat on its own, your brain to function, your blood vessels to work, every organ in your body to function the way it was meant and created for. The moment that energy comes out, you're done. Your body collapses. The nafs on the other hand is the one that controls your behavior. You have control over your nafs, but you have no control over your ruh. So that's very important to make this distinction. And the Quran of course, since we're talking about the Nafs divided those Nafs, groups. And Nafs Al Amar Bisu, and Nafs Al Amar Bisu, Three groups. Is that who has the that always lead them to do bad things. Which many of us kind of fall in that category is the that leads you to do something bad and then regret it, feel sorry, repent, ask Allah to forgive you and then do another bad thing and, you know, back and forth. And is this may Allah give us such. Is the that is at peace with itself, with the people around it, and with Allah. And that's that only leads you to good to goodness, lead you to kindness, lead you to help others and be good in your life. Now the question is, since now we know that we have control over over our nafs. You just told us it's like driving a car or like riding a horse. So how do I control my nafs? How do I train it? How do I force it to go in the direction I want it to go? And that will be inshallah in the next five minutes in the in the second. So in the first kuppah, we kind of define the problem. We knew that everyone recognize that we need to change as individuals, as families, as communities, as an ummah. And we always refer to the verse on the Quran, Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will not change the affairs of the ummah unless they change themselves. And we also said that change is collective as long as the individuals adhere to the rules of change for that change to make an impact. Now, how do we change ourselves as individuals? I'm going to give you the recipe for success, for such change. Not my not, you know, brother Musaab's recipe. This is the recipe that Allah put for us in the Quran. If you follow it, will Allah you will change. Number one, and this is all from the Quran. Number one, remember when Allah told the prophet to invite his people to the path of Allah, to say, What is the first thing he taught him? Iqra. Read. Read. Unfortunately, we are an ommah that doesn't read. It's a fact. We are an ommah that doesn't read. Right? And we only read when we have a problem, we go and search for a solution or ask the sheikh. Right? Read. Educate ourselves about our deen, about nature, about things around us. The first thing is to have knowledge, is to read, is to educate yourself. Because without knowledge, you know, as many of the the the wise people said, Whoever worships Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala based on ignorance, it's as if you disobey him. When you don't know what to read in the salah or how to make sujood or ruku or ruku or even how to make dua. Right? Then you have a problem. That's number one. Read. Get the basic knowledge about this thing. Number two, is to understand the purpose of your presence in this dunya. SubhanAllah, many of us, Muslims and otherwise, fail to find that purpose. We always live for ourselves, for our wife and children, you know, get a job, have a family, and and then go to retirement and die and disappear. We leave no fingerprints behind. We leave nothing behind. There's no legacy. You know, people will even not notice that we even been here before because we fail to understand the purpose of life. And Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala reminds us in the Quran, we read the Quran, Do you think that we have created you without purpose and that you would never be returned to us? There is a purpose for our existence, for our presence in this dunya. And that purpose is to establish life on earth, is to instill justice and righteousness on earth, and to worship Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. That's our role. Now everything else, a wife, a child, a house, a car, that's risk. That's guaranteed. Wallahi, it's guaranteed. Wallahi, if you sleep many many scholars even say that you don't have to do to get risk. Your risk is. Wallahi, if you sit at home and do nothing, Allah will bring that risk to you. To bring it to you, it's decided the day you were born. But many of us are so overly occupied with risk. How do I earn the next green dollar? Right? And in return, we forget about our children. Right? Understand your purpose. And to feel the value of your life is when you live your life for others, not for yourself, not for your children, not your friend, for your family. Once you feel like you're making an impact on the lives of others, Allah will open doors for you and will give you this feeling of satisfaction, tranquility. It's it's a special feeling. You know the story that, you know, that we built this rehabilitation room in Gaza. Now we're building the emergency room in Gaza with the help of this generous community and the and the the Houston community at large. SubhanAllah, the feeling you get by helping others who are terribly in need in Gaza and elsewhere around the world gives you this special feeling that you realize your purpose in life is not just for you and your families. And that's very important to realize my dear respected brothers and sisters. Do you think this life is just fun and play? It's not. So one number one is to read and understand. Number two, understand your purpose in life. Why are we here? What does Allah wants from me? There is a reason for me being here. It's not just eat and drink and have fun and raise kids and just leave. That's it. There is a reason. But if you live for others, you will appreciate the value of your life more. Number three, have a good relationship between you Allah because once you understand your purpose, once you develop your knowledge, your main concern in this dunya is not where should I earn the next hundred dollars. It's how can I please Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala? Those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in remembrance of Allah, in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah, do hearts find comfort. Number four, work on your nafs. As we said, nafs can be controlled. It's not, you know, a wild animal just runs on its own. You can control it by teaching it, by being in the vicinity of those who will lead you to the right path and help you. Right? Teach your nefs to be patient. None of us is having an easy life. I can tell you that. Everyone is struggling in their own way. If it's in health, financial, marital, whatever that is, everyone is struggling. But to to weather the storm of life, have good relationship with Allah because Allah promised us. He said, Whoever does good, whether it's a male or a female while believing, we will give them a good life. A good life doesn't mean a lot of money. Big houses, big cars. It means satisfaction, contentment. It to sleep at night and you have good relationship with Allah away from sin. Be patient and be flexible. Right? Be optimistic and I'll just go over the the the quick ones inshallah. Be optimistic in your life. Lost his son for more than thirty years some narration say, but he never lost hope in Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. He says, Look at the stories of the prophets before and the messengers. Learn from their experiences. In their stories, there is truly a lesson for people of reason. I will end with one. Now forget everything I just told you. If you insist in hanging out with bad friends. Forget everything I just told you. If you insist on making the change I talked about, but you insist in hanging out with bad friends who always lead you to bad things. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says in the Quran Close friends will be enemies to one another on the day of judgment except the righteous. And the prophet said, A believer is a mirror image of a man is a mirror image of his friend, so pick your friend.
